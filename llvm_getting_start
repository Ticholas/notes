SSA -- static single assignment
	is a property of IR, which requires each variable is exactly assigned once, and every variable is defined before it is used.
	use variable renaming to achieve SSA
	but when a basic block has more than one predecessor basic blocks, there will be a problem
	when some variable exists in both basic blocks, so which one will the current basic block choose?
	e.g. y <- x + 1 --> y <- x1 + 1 or y <- x2 + 1 ?
	so => y <- phi(x1, x2)

phi-node
phi instruction:
	phi 
	<result> = phi <ty> [ <val0>, <label0>], ...
	a value-label pair for each predecessor basic block
